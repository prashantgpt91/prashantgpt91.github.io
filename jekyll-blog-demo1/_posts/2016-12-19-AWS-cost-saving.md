It was a real pleasure to attend re:Invent this year for the first time. We met some awesome companies doing amazing things in the cloud.












The scale was incredible as we were inundated with requests for conversations about how our automation tools manage to save our customers so much money in the cloud. We were also overwhelmed by the number of requests we had for technical partnerships and can't wait to announce some exciting integrations in the coming months.

By far the most exciting part for us though is that Amazon Web Services chose to recommend GorillaStack as a key tool for cost optimisation based on the millions of dollars that we've already saved for our customers.

Hear in their very own words how GorillaStack can save you more than 53% on your AWS bill.
