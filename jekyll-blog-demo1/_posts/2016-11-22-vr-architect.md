Since smartphones and tablets are advancing rapidly on both the hardware and software front, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality applications are finding their way in everyday life. One particular set of professionals who are going to benefit from this are the Architects.









In order to provide architects with a more dynamic way to showcase their work, we decided to develop an application VR|ARchitect to exploit both VR and AR fields to project and interact with 3D models in the current surrounding with help of smartphones. This would undoubtedly save the time and money invested when building a physical model to display building plans and also enable the viewer/user to explore the model.
The VR|ARchitect App looks to target the Android and iOS markets primarily (also for Microsoft HoloLens). The application allows the users to upload 3D models created using Google SketchUp or similar 3D Modelling software and with the help of a marker image, project the model into the current environment. These marker images can be customized and printed out on visiting cards which easily can fit into a bag or wallet. The App allows the users to interact with these models in real-time by rotating or resizing the model on the phone to avoid having to move around to see the entire model or even look at it from different views / camera angles with just a click of a button. 
In case, the users’ work emphasizes more on the interiors, the VR mode (requires Google Cardboard or similar VR devices) provides an immersive experience of being present inside the house, allowing the user to walk around and obtain a 360-degree view of it.
The application will come with an Admin Dashboard that allows the user to manage all their models and designs that will operate on a cloud platform, thereby freeing the users’ devices of the memory required to store these models.

The demo video below will provide a vague idea of the application and some of the basic functionalities.
