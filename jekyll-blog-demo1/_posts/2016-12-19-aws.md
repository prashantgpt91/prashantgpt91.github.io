Just this week Amazon announced that you can now schedule your Auto Scaling from the AWS console. Previously this was only available from the CLI.













This is a great offering -  at GorillaStack we welcome anything that will make users' lives easier when it comes to using the cloud and [AWS Cost Management](https://www.gorillastack.com/v2/?utm_expid=104293775-5.f2V_hIYaQgWrWlcLoxrtZA.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2F). 

Our view is that Scheduled Auto Scaling has always been a great concept â€“ so we spoke to other AWS users in the community. We discovered what they wanted and built out Power Scale, a product with some notable upgrades to the AWS console's features.

With Power Scale, users can:

 - Schedule multiple regions at the same time
 - Schedule multiple groups at the same time
 - Schedule by tag
 - Snooze and cancel scheduled changes
 - Enjoy a rich integration with Slack and Hipchat
 - Circumvent monthly limit constraints
 - Schedule in local timezones


To find out how each of these features compares to the current AWS offering - read our full blog post about [AWS Scheduled Auto Scaling](https://blog.gorillastack.com/7-powerful-features-that-will-enhance-your-aws-auto-scaling-schedules/).
