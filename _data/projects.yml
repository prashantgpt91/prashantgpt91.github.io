    I’m a big fan of static site generators. I’ve used Jekyll to power numerous websites, including this one. But despite the clear advantages static sites can have over their database-driven, dynamic counterparts, it didn’t take long for me to feel a paradigmatic pain point: if there is no back-end to receive and process forms with user input, how can I add user-generated content? To address that, I built Staticman, a service that receives, processes and transforms content into data files, pushed to a GitHub repository where the rest of your content lives. Staticman creates a pull request whenever an entry is submitted: merge it to accept the submission, or close it to send it away.

    I’m very interested in web performance. Making sure websites load and become responsive as quickly as possible is a determinant factor in user experience, engagement and even revenue. As a developer, this is something that I take into consideration at all times when working on a project, but I feel it’s equally important that performance data can be something that everyone in a team or organisation, regardless of their technical background, can access and act upon. SpeedTracker is a service that constantly monitors various performance metrics of a website and displays them in an easy-to-consume dashboard, allowing people to quickly assess how new features or infrastructural changes have impacted the perceived performance for users across the world.

    To make the web evolve in a sane and sustainable way for both users and developers, browser vendors work together to standardise new features, whether it’s a new HTML element, CSS property, or JavaScript API. But it’s very unlikely that said feature will land on all the major browsers at once, not to mention the older (but still widely used) browsers that will never get it. In practice, choosing to use a certain feature is making a decision about the list of browsers that the site will optimally support. To help developers make these decisions consciously rather than accidentally, I created compat-report, a developer tools extension for identifying and visualising cross-browser compatibility issues.

    include-media came about as a result of intense research and experimentation with how Sass can help front-end developers write responsive sites in a simple and maintainable way. I documented the process and the findings in an [article on CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/approaches-media-queries-sass/) and published include-media, a library focused on providing a simple, intuitive and natural syntax for maintaining breakpoints and writing media queries. It currently has over 12,000 downloads a month on npm and there’s an interesting ecosystem of community-built plugins and extensions around it.

  title: Detect duplicate Youtube videos
  copy: >
    This project was done as my masters project under Prof. Joydip Dhar. it is an app where once you search for any video on youtube, you wouldn't be bombarded with frsutrating video results. Idea was to elminate duplicate and show clean results to user. This would ultimately lead to a better recommendation engine that runs behind billions of videos & will help channel owners gain more traffic, not sure about Youtube though.
