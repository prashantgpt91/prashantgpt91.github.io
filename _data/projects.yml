    From the early days of my professional career, I was very much interested in vision for machines. This project was the building block for me to enter into the very same field. Our objective was to create an API that can process the reciepts. The complete pipeline was divided into three modules. Details will be added soon.

  title: Detect duplicate Youtube videos
  copy: >
    This project was done as my masters project under Prof. Joydip Dhar. it is an app where once you search for any video on youtube, you wouldn't be bombarded with frsutrating video results. Idea was to elminate duplicate and show clean results to user. This would ultimately lead to a better recommendation engine that runs behind billions of videos & will help channel owners gain more traffic, not sure about Youtube though.

    I’m a big fan of static site generators. I’ve used Jekyll to power numerous websites, including this one. But despite the clear advantages static sites can have over their database-driven, dynamic counterparts, it didn’t take long for me to feel a paradigmatic pain point: if there is no back-end to receive and process forms with user input, how can I add user-generated content? To address that, I built Staticman, a service that receives, processes and transforms content into data files, pushed to a GitHub repository where the rest of your content lives. Staticman creates a pull request whenever an entry is submitted: merge it to accept the submission, or close it to send it away.
