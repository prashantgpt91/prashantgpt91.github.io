message: "It is obvious that the images and other binary resources must lie with the main document in one folder. \r\n\r\n```\r\n_posts/\r\n  2000-01-01-article/\r\n    2000-01-01-article.md\r\n    image.png\r\n    document.pdf\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut no! Jekyll all about simplicity https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/881. Why do we need a convenient and simple structure of the documents? Better we will tinker with a separate directory. But it's would more convenient for developers."
