message: "Thanks for this share! Very useful.\r\nJust noticed that, for my setup (cloned from https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now),\r\nI needed to add \".html\" after the file-name to be included:\r\n```\r\n{% include image.html name=\"linkedin-before.png\" caption=\"Sharing my blog on LinkedIn\" %}\r\n```\r\nDunno why, but maybe this will save someone a bit of head-scratching"
