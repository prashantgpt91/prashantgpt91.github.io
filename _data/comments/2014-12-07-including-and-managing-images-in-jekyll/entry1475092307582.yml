message: "Many thanks for a brilliantly simple solution. I am currently porting my site from WP for all the usual reason and rebuilding it in Jekyll. Since I am a newbie, this is a slow and painful process. This helped solve a major issue for me. I am still researching ways to generate thumbnails of post images at the build. Any clues would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks again."
