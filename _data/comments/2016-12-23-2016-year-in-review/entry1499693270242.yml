message: "Thanks for the article. Really like what I've seen on your blog so far. And big thumbs up for making Staticman.\r\n\r\nRegarding open source issues and demotivation: Personally, receiving issues excites me. It means that someone cares about my product and that together we have a chance make it better. You have to realize that the Issues section of Github is there to report issues, not to shower praise on the developer. If you still have a hard time dealing with the tone of strangers on the internet (which half the time is misinterpreted), I would kindly recommend undergoing some emotional hardening. It will come in handy throughout your life.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nMonty"
