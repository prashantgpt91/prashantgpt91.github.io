message: "Thanks buddy , but I am facing issue sending the ajax request to different domain in this case, I get error as \"No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.\" as browser blocks you from sending ajax request to different domain. \r\n\r\nAs I checked your code you are not using ajax, so I need to now change it to as you used it"
