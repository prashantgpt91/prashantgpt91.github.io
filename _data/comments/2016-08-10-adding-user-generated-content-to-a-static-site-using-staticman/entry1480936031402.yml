message: "We offer some ways to mitigate spam, such as support for a honeypot field and integration with Akismet. These aren't perfect and there is still some spam that goes through, which is an issue I definitely want to revisit.\r\n\r\nAs for Popcorn, it's true that the repo is piling up with comments, but the vast majority is generated by actual humans and not spam bots, despite the random nature of the content. :)"
