message: "I'm having trouble getting the links correct in the feed outputs. I'm only getting the relative part of the url. The \"| prepend site.site_url\" does nothing for me. \r\n\r\nThen I tried {{ site.base_url}} before the post url and nothing happens. I tried that as I am using that in other parts of the blog.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing?"
