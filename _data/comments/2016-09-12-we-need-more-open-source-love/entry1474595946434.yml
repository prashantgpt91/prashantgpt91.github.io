message: "I like the positive feedback idea and I believe an implementation in some way should occur. \r\n\r\nFor me, open source is about sharing. Sharing to improve/learn, sharing development burden, sharing the rewards - access to great code.  When most individuals are only users then the sharing to use balance is skewed. Open source can only exist if sharing occurs and individuals volunteer their time. Obvious, yes.\r\n\r\nI believe many more people want to contribute. They might not know how or might not understand that even a small contribution goes a long way. And from my perspective, an easy contribution, and a great way to get started, might not even need to be a code contribution but a text or verbal gratitude. Surely this will encourage more people to contribute and support those who already are. It could also be an early warning sign that support for a project is waning. \r\n\r\nStars are a great sign of the number of users expressing interest over time but people do not really unstar when they stop using a project. So stars do not provide the current instantaneous trend. And like you suggest, I agree that a thank you or I love and use 'feature X', from your opensource contribution, will be a great insight. It could direct where efforts can be prioritised to. I think it would also help guide the future direction of an opensource project. \r\n\r\nAfter all a text or verbal gratitude is a negligible cost but leaves a profound positive impact. Who knows where this positive impact will take us..."
