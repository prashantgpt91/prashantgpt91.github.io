message: "An absolute Simple explanation\r\n I am fully convinced you couldn't have done better in explaining what has happened \r\nI'd really grown sceptical because the kind of ICO's that keep coming for the greed of money \r\nI was very happy to see a democratic architecture coming for internet \r\nI will fully support to the best of my ability \r\nmaking yourself available to the investors is a great way to be open to accepting your mistakes and your faults... and it happens with everybody during the course of success..\r\nYour admins have been great on the telegram channel helping novice investors. \r\nWhat is more interesting to read is what all Dadi will be doing for the future of consensus-based internet and what all can we expect in the future on blockchain and from Dadi\r\n\r\nMy Best Regards"
