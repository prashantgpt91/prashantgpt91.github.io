  Good update. I was worried, especially because I really thought this was such
  a promising project. I’m glad you’ve made yourself available to the community
  to explain yourself and the status of the project. It take a big person to
  admit fault and I value your openness is wanting to do better. Good luck Sir!
  I’ll be backing you guys.
