message: "Hello Eduardo,\r\n\r\nThanks for this message. I agree with you that building and executing fast is more important than anything to survive and thrive as a company. I respect that perspective and approach. \r\nHowever, it would have been wiser to start this message by putting yourself in people's shoes and apologize clearly to start on and acknowledge your mistake clearly. Then ask people to put themselves in your shoes. Not the other way.\r\n\r\nThis is a widely known principle to apply in leadership, communication, and psychology. Your message would have been more effective and would sound more sincere and not like if your objective is to protect yourself.\r\n\r\nI share this as a constructive feedback. Most of the times, simply and sincerely saying \"sorry I made a mistake\" is enough. \r\n\r\nI will still invest IF ( big IF ) I'm whitelisted ( your KYC and whitelist approach is not communicated clearly and not every registered people will get a spot ). \r\n\r\nAll the best"
