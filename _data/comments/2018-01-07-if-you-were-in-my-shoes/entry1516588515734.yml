  If it is a mistake, I understand; but it has still been a week while you
  haven't cited SONM in your whitepaper. I know that the DADI team is obviously
  scrambling to have everything in line as it is released, but it would seem
  well worth the time to just cite SONM in your whitepaper to correct your
  mistake?
