message: "Hi Eduardo.\r\n\r\nKudos for admitting the (small) mistake, and also kudos for standing up for your team. At first I got the same nervous reaction because I liked the project and feared that it was \"scammy\". But when actually investigating what happened, it seems to be a really tiny thing that has nothing to do with the project -- and this is why I like that you \"bite\" back on the flame war that was started.\r\n\r\nGood luck - My curiosity for this project has not been shaken by this!"
