  A non technical person and one, very amateur, digitally, but an intelligent
  animal and observer of what is happening in consumer behaviours across a range
  of matters, I completely 'get' what the dadi team is trying to achieve and the
  consumer benefits associated with what they will do. The investment case is
  compelling and first mover advantage is a good reason to back this team. I
  have been associated with many a brand launch myself, and know that the odd
  hiccup will occur, but also that these will never detract from a great
  proposition...
