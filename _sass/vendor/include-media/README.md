# include-media
> Simple, elegant and maintainable media queries in Sass

[![NPM badge](https://nodei.co/npm/include-media.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/include-media)

## What?

**include-media** is a Sass library for writing CSS media queries in an easy and maintainable way, using a natural and simplistic syntax.

## Why?

I spent quite some time experimenting with different libraries and mixins available out there, but eventually all of them failed to do everything I needed in an elegant way. Some of them wouldn't let me mix set breakpoints with case-specific values, others wouldn't properly handle the CSS OR operator and most of them had a syntax that I found complicated and unnatural.

**include-media** was the result of that experience and it includes all the features I wish I had found before, whilst maintaining a simplistic and natural syntax.

## How to install

- With Bower: `bower install include-media`
- Manually: get [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eduardoboucas/include-media/master/dist/_include-media.scss)

Finally, include the file in your project using an `@import` statement.
