<h2>The Importance of Model Interpretability</h2>
<p>As machine learning models become more complex and are deployed in critical business applications, the need for interpretability has never been greater. This article explores practical strategies for making your models more explainable.</p>

<h2>Types of Interpretability</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Global Interpretability:</strong> Understanding the model's overall behavior</li>
  <li><strong>Local Interpretability:</strong> Explaining individual predictions</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best interpretable model is often not the most accurate one, but the one that stakeholders can trust and act upon.</p>
</blockquote>
