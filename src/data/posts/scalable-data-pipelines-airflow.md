<h2>Introduction to Apache Airflow</h2>
<p>Apache Airflow has emerged as the de facto standard for orchestrating complex data workflows. This comprehensive guide will walk you through building scalable, maintainable data pipelines that can handle enterprise-level workloads.</p>

<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs):</strong> The blueprint of your workflow</li>
  <li><strong>Tasks:</strong> Individual units of work within a DAG</li>
  <li><strong>Operators:</strong> Templates for common tasks</li>
  <li><strong>Hooks:</strong> Interfaces to external systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Practices for Production</h2>
<p>When deploying Airflow in production environments, consider these critical factors:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Properly configure worker resources and task concurrency</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Implement comprehensive logging and alerting</li>
  <li><strong>Security:</strong> Secure your Airflow instance and manage credentials properly</li>
  <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Develop robust testing strategies for your DAGs</li>
</ol>
