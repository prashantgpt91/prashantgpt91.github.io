I'm Prashant Gupta, working as <b>Lead Data Sciences at Yodlee</b> based out of Bengaluru, India.
Having studied Engineering Mathematics, Probability, Statistics, Machine Learning, AI & Data Mining as subjects in my masters academic curriculum, had settled a solid foundation for me in the field of Data science. A good exposure in building backend services for <a href="https://www.stegosoc.com/">StegoSOC</a> <a href="https://www.ziwid.com/">Ziwid</a> <a href="https://receiptbot.herokuapp.com/">Receiptbot</a> along with deploying end to end ML models is what I have been doing for a while now.

Check out my projects <a href="/projects"> here</a>.
