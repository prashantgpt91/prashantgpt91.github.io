Feature Extraction from texts using **Word2vec**

To get a better semantic understanding of a word, word2vec was published for nlp community.

First, I will show you how to use pretrained word2vec model by Google trained on Google News dataset. Though it seems easy but the statistics behind the load time of model due to it's humongous size is something to ponder upon.

> Simple model loading using genism and doing some magic. Take a look at execution time mentioned in script comments.

As can be seen from stats mentioned, it took around 55 sec in loading the model, everytime I had to run this model, which is Ugly.

Ok, so far so good. Now let's try to make model loading faster. But how ?
