The news that Tim Wood, maintainer of popular JavaScript library [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/), was [stepping away from the project](https://medium.com/@timrwood/moment-endof-term-522d8965689#.7tfeiopqb) was a wake-up call for the open-source community. His reasons, although super easy to understand and relate to, are not discussed often enough.<!--more-->

>> Seeing bugs and issues continue to roll in and being mentally unable to address them has led to feelings of failure and depression. When looking at the moment project, I could only see the negatives. The bugs and misnomers and mistakes I had made. It let to a cycle of being too depressed to contribute, which led to being depressed because I wasnâ€™t contributing.

Many developers came forward to speak about the issue, like Dave DeSandro, the man behind projects like [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) and [Flickity](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/).

I completely relate to this. On a much smaller scale, I've dedicated huge amounts of my personal time to projects like [include-media](http://include-media.com) and [Staticman](https://staticman.net/), and yet the vast majority of feedback I ever get from anyone are bug reports or feature requests (luckily, I never had to deal with [this level](https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/759085713845587968) of harshness).

Instead of only coming across the negative comments, I would love to hear from people that use these projects successfully and to learn about how they helped make their jobs and lives a tiny bit easier. Their experiences would certainly teach me a lot about my own projects and the positive feedback would be a huge motivation boost to help me keep going.

Even something as simple as "I'm using this project on this site" means a lot. Sure, the number of stars on a GitHub repository is an indication that people are using and loving what you've done, but at the same time it's very impersonal. I always feel that putting a name and a face to a positive review of something you've done is infinitely more rewarding than any number on a badge.

## A compendium of love (cheesy?)

I thought it'd be cool to create a compendium of positive feedback about open-source projects. Sort of the opposite of GitHub issues, it would be a website where open-source projects could have their own page with user-generated comments, or simply links to places where the project is being used.

To project maintainers, this would be a way of collecting useful feedback. On the other hand, the general user could see how other people are using and benefiting from a certain project, potentially helping them make a decision about using it or not.

What are your thoughts? Does anything like this exist already? If not, shall we build it?<!--tomb-->
