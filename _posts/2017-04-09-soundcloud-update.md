For me, It rolled out very tough, when it comes to sing with or without karaoke. I tried a mix of both in these three beautiful songs.

The sensational romantic song from Bollywood Movie *Kuch Kuch Hota hai* was not an easy one to try. Although this song was originally sung by Udit Narayan, but I eventually got inspiration from [this performance of arijit singh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHkcGNCfjns). A special memory related to this song -  I usually record on my laptop multiple times for a particular song and probably it gets better after each recording (P.S - as far as it seems to me :P) 

But surprisingly the version uploaded on soundcloud for this song was my first attempt to this song.

And again from a typical arijit fan, what can one expect. Another lovely song, No special memories towards this, multiple tries, some noise cleaning using Audacity and that's it.

Probably the worst song I have ever sung and recorded too :D. This is the reason why I uploaded only 11 seconds for this one. But this trial was completely on Karaoke.
