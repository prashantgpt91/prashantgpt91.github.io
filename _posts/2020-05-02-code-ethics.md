Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors.

As a developer, I would always want my code to 

* use the same format everywhere (like tabs and spaces)
* use the best practices for good quality (like let/const rather than var)

Code formatter solves the first problem, it reprints the entire program from scratch in a consistent way.


Code linter solves the second problem, it helps to use the better syntaxes or new features of the programming languages and catch possible errors, but itâ€™s not able to solve some difficult ones, like variable naming.
