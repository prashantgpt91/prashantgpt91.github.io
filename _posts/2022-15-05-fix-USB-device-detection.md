Format drive using cmd, when USB is write protected.

* diskpart
* list disk
* select disk x (where x is the number of your non-working drive â€“ use the capacity to work out which one it is)
* attributes disk clear readonly
* clean
* create partition primary
* format fs=fat32  (you can swap fat32 for ntfs if you only need to use the drive with Windows computers)
* exit
